In other words, using the Caesar cipher, **you cannot encrypt a message without also knowing how to decrypt it**.   In general, an encryption algorithm in which knowledge of how to encrypt is equal to (or an easy transformation of) knowledge of how to decrypt is called a **symmetric-key algorithm**.\n","\n","For much of human history (including through World War II), essentially all encryption algorithms were symmetric-key algorithms, although they were far more elaborate than shift ciphers.
